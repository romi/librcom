# rcom

rcom is light-weight libary for inter-node communication. It provides
both server-side and client-side websockets. We'll call them client
end-point and server end-points. A separate application, called
'rcom-registry' is a directory server that maintains the list of all
server end-points. The rcom-registry application should be launched
separately before any other application.

The server end-points are identified using a topic, which is a
free-form string. The topic should be unique for a given
rcom-registry. Client end-points that want to communicate with a
server first contact the rcom-registry to obtain the address of the
server end-point. The address is simply a combination of IP address
and port number. The client can then connect to the server end-point
directly.

An application can open several server end-points. And a single server
end-point can handle many clients.

The rcom library does not impose any format on the messages sent back
and forth between the client and the server. Since the websocket
standard makes a distinction between text-based, so does rcom. But
under the hood, rcom is agnostic about the content of the messages.
